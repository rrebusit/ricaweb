Welcome to my website! Thank you for viewing and click on the *Blog Posts* tab above to check out some of my personal interests and projects about data science!

## Some things about me: 
I graduated CSU Chico of May 2023 with a B.S. in Applied Mathematics and the certificate of Data Science. At my time at Chico State, one of my professors recommended I engage in the Data Science Initiative where I soon began to take part in projects that were presented in Chico State's NSC Poster Sessions.



This helped me as I gained more experience with real clients and helped me realize what I am strong at and what I need to work more at. I am interested in machine learning and I am fond of Random Forest Classification.

Aside from data science, I have other hobbies such as:

-   Traveling

-   Playing the guitar

-   Sports

-   Fitness

-   Watching anime

-   Playing with my dog
