Welcome to my website! Thank you for viewing and click on the **Blog Posts** tab above to check out some of my personal technical interests and projects about data science!

## Some things about me: 
I graduated CSU Chico of May 2023 with a B.S. in Applied Mathematics and the certificate of Data Science. At my time at Chico State, one of my professors recommended I engage in the Data Science Initiative where I soon began to take part in projects that were presented in Chico State's NSC Poster Sessions. You can take a look at the posters in the **Project Posters** tab above! 

This helped me as I gained more experience with real clients and helped me realize what I am strong at and what I need to work more at. I am interested in machine learning and I am fond of Random Forest Classification. There is so much to do with data and I am always eager and excited learn and expand my knowledge!

Aside from data science, I have other hobbies and interests such as:

### Traveling
My favorite place I have traveled to would have to be Mexico or Australia!

My next dream destination would be Taiwan because I love bubble tea (boba) and want to visit the first bubble tea shop there!

### Music
I love listening to mostly pop. My favorite artist currently is Dua Lipa. I even went to her concert in San Jose in March 2022! Here is a little clip from her concert!

I also like to listen to K-pop. My favorite groups are Girls' Generation, TWICE, ITZY, Billlie and LE SSERAFIM!

### Playing the Instruments
I have been playing the ukulele since around 2020, but recently, I have picked up on playing the guitar! My style of playing is fingerstyle because I can not sing. I know how to play Fly Me To the Moon by Frank Sinatra on guitar and currently I am learning how to play Ditto by NewJeans. Learning how to play an instrument is difficult but the process is so fun!

### Sports
Ever since I was little, I loved being active. My favorite sport is basketball and I played competitively from 5th grade up to my senior year of highschool! I love being part of a team and having a bond with my teammates. My favorite NBA team is the Warriors. I also enjoy playing tennis here and there. 

### Fitness
If there is one place you can find me, it is at the gym! I go early in the morning so that for the rest of the day, I can be productive.

### Watching Anime
My top 3 anime have got to be Demon Slayer, Naruto, and Attack on Titan! If you want to watch an anime that will make you cry, definitely watch Anohana. 

### My Pets
